Getting the actual recording to work was surprisingly simple, using sounddevice and scipy and wavio. However, getting the conversion from a .wav file to a .mp3 file (the type this program recognises) was an interesting task to say the least.\n\nNext steps are to improve the experience of recording an audio entry (visible timer, add dates to the view audio entries page so stuff is in order etc.) but we are getting there!"
